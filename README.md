# keytar - Node module to manage system keychain

[![Build
Status](https://travis-ci.org/atom/node-keytar.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/atom/node-keytar)

A native Node module to get, add, replace, and delete passwords in system's
keychain. On OS X the passwords are managed by the Keychain, on Linux they are
managed by Gnome Keyring and on Windows they are managed by Credential Vault.

## Installing

```sh
npm install keytar
```

### On Linux

Currently this library uses the gnome-keyring so you may need to run `sudo apt-get install libgnome-keyring-dev` before `npm install`ing.

If you are using a Red Hat-based system you need to run `sudo yum install libgnome-keyring-devel`.

## Building
  * Clone the repository
  * Run `npm install`
  * Run `grunt` to compile the native and CoffeeScript code
  * Run `grunt test` to run the specs

## Docs

```coffeescript
keytar = require 'keytar'
```
