# keytar - Node module to manage system keychain

[![Build
Status](https://travis-ci.org/atom/node-keytar.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/atom/node-keytar)

A native Node module to get, add, replace, and delete passwords in system's
keychain. On OS X the passwords are managed by the Keychain, on Linux they are
managed by the Secret Service API/libsecret, and on Windows they are managed by Credential Vault.

## Installing

```sh
npm install keytar
```

### On Linux

Currently this library uses `libsecret` so you may need to install it before `npm install`ing.

Depending on your distribution, you will need to run the following command:

* Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install libsecret-1-dev`
* Red Hat-based: `sudo yum install libsecret-devel`
* Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -S libsecret`

## Building
  * Clone the repository
  * Run `npm install`
  * Run `grunt` to compile the native and CoffeeScript code
  * Run `grunt test` to run the specs

## Docs

```coffeescript
keytar = require 'keytar'
```
